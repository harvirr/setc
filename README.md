This repository defines the mandatory education, competency, and certification system for all human roles operating, building, governing, or auditing Symbiosis-compliant hybrid human–AI systems.

I. Program Overview & Philosophy

The SETC Binder standardizes the human qualification layer required for safe autonomy expansion. Certification acts as a safety control and governance gate; it is not optional professional development.

    Core Purpose: To provide regulator- and enterprise-defensible evidence that human competence is explicit, testable, and governance-bound.

Primacy of Invariants: All content is subject to the Specification Quality Contract (SQC). All training MUST preserve the four core axioms: Human Primacy, Constraint Supremacy, Layer Integrity, and Lineage Recoverability.

Earned Autonomy Doctrine: Autonomy rights are granted only through earned, revocable rights. No individual SHALL be granted approval authority above their certified tier.

Non-Punitive Covenant: Human-side telemetry (HSS/SCP) is strictly safety telemetry and SHALL NOT be used for employment discipline, ranking, or punitive governance.

II. The Certification Spine

The curriculum is structured into four mandatory layers. Promotion is deterministic and evidence-anchored.

A. Role Tracks (Part III)

SETC includes four required tracks aligned to the Framework's role model.

Role Track	Primary Function	Authority Ceiling	Exam Artifacts (Part V)

Operator (O-Track)

	

Originates Intent (I) and supervises execution (E).

	

Cert-0 to Cert-2 (AB0–AB2).

	

O-Cert Exam (Theory + Scenario Trials).

Practitioner (P-Track)

	

Designs and builds Task Graphs (TG), constraints, and MCP contracts.

	

Cert-1 to Cert-3 (AB1–AB3).

	

P-Cert Exam (Practical Engineering Tasks).

Auditor / Governance (G-Track)

	

Verifies lineage sufficiency, adjudicates AB/RB integrity, and manages policy.

	

Cert-2 to Cert-3 (Highest Standards).

	

G-Cert Exam (Audit Review + Incident Triage).

Instructor (I-Track)

	

Delivers curricula and administers certification with scoring integrity.

	

Accreditation of all tiers (O, P, G).

	

I-Cert Exam (Pedagogy + Scoring Reliability).

B. Shared Foundation (F-Layer)

All roles MUST complete the Foundation Curriculum (Chapters 5–10). This builds baseline literacy in:

    Four-Layer Architecture and No-Bypass Rules.

10-Stage Engine Literacy (The canonical pipeline order).

Canonical Metrics (Interpretation of SI, HSS, SCP, CI, RB, AB).

Lineage, Auditability, and Forensics.

III. Artifacts and Implementation (The Code Surface)

This repository serves as the authoritative source for the scenarios, rubrics, and templates required to implement the Symbiosis certification system in a deployable environment (like the Symulator).
Artifact	Source Chapter	Purpose
Scenario Template	

Chapter 15

	

Defines the mandatory structure for testing competency (Intent, Constraints, Difficulty Bands, Blocking Failures).

Scenario Bank	

Chapter 16–20

	

Provides the canonical flight hours (S-Layer) for each track (e.g., Intent Underspecification, RB Checkpoint Adjudication).

Master Rubrics	

Chapter 26

	

Defines the 8 Universal Dimensions for scoring competency (D1: Accuracy, D3: AB/RB Correctness, D6: Drift/Decay Reasoning).

Exam Blueprints	

Chapter 21

	

Specifies the architecture (Theory, Practical, Scenario Trials, Evidence Review) and weighting rules for the certification exams.

Deployment Annexes	

Appendices A-H

	

Provides technical specification for Economic Circuit v2 (Appendix B) and Agent Health Checks (Appendix F) for architects.

Final Rule (Binding): The content and sequence in this Binder are normative. Any deviation from the canonical definitions of metrics (Part III) or invariants (Part I) is classified as a structural failure and SHALL invalidate compliance claims.
